## 10/27/2025 - Research + Keymatrix  

 Today i spent around 2 Hours Doing Research on the specific key set i would like to do. seting up the github repository and planning what i would like to do. 

These are the Keycaps i would like to use from Ali Express.

Then i spent the rest of my time Doing the most Repetitive and irritatingly complex task the Keyboard Matrix Schematic. This is Quite literaly my most complex and messy schematic.

## 10/29/2025 - Finished Schematic and Layed Out Components On PCB  

Today i spend aroud 4 Hours Finsihing off the Schematic and Deciding what GPIO Expander to use. I was initialy going to use the TCA9539PWR From Texas Instruments But after researching that didnt have any support with the KMK firmware so in the end i used the MCP23017.  I also learnt about how Rotary Encoder Switches work and added 2 to the schematic.
